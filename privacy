I do not automatically collect any data when you play this game.

You may if you choose send me the logs of game play, via the log button.I use this data to redesign puzzels and fix bugs.
This data is gameplay data about what you did in the game with regard to puzzel moves. It also
tells me what your device, screen size and opperating system is. It sends the email from your email.
If you dont want me to have the email anymore you can send me an email asking me to delete your pii.
But the data in the email is not pii, and cannot be used to identify you in anyway.

But I do not have any of that unless you choose to send it to me.
