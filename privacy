I do not automatically collect any data when you play this game.

You may if you choose send me the logs of game play, via the log button. But this data is game play data about what you did in the game with regard to puzzel moves. It also
tells me what your device, screen size and opperating system is. It sends the email from your email linked to your phone, but I can delete your email if you like, there is no pii in the data itself,
But I do not have any of that unless you choose to send it to me. 
I use this data to redesign puzzels and fix bugs.
